# ACIT 2420 Assignment 3 Part 1

## Webgen Setup Instructions
The webgen system will create the following directory structure:
```
/var/lib/webgen/
├── bin/
│   └── generate_index
└── HTML/
    └── index.html
```

- The `generate_index` script will need to be moved into `/var/lib/webgen/bin/` (to be seen later) to generates the HTML.
- The `HTML` directory contains the `index.html` file (generated by `generate_index`), which is served by `nginx`.

## Creating the System User

To enhance security and prevent accidental system changes, the `webgen` user is created to run the script instead of using a regular user or root. Using a system user minimizes the risk of security vulnerabilities and ensures that only the required permissions will be granted.
```bash
sudo useradd -r -s /bin/bash webgen
```
## Setting Up Directories and Permissions
- You will need to create the directories:
```bash
sudo mkdir -p /var/lib/webgen/bin
sudo mkdir -p /var/lib/webgen/HTML
```
- The webgen user needs the proper permissions to read/write to the bin and HTML directories. 

```bash
sudo chown -R webgen:webgen /var/lib/webgen
sudo chmod u=rwx,g=rx,o= /var/lib/webgen /var/lib/webgen/HTML
```

## Moving the `generate_index` Script
- The generate_index script should be placed in /var/lib/webgen/bin/. This script generates system information in HTML.

- Using sftp you can transfer the file from your local machine:
```bash
put "path\to\generate_index"
```
- Then you can move it to `/var/lib/webgen/bin/` using:
```bash
sudo mv generate_index /var/lib/webgen/bin/
```
- You will need to give it the correct ownership and permissions:
```bash
sudo chown webgen:webgen /var/lib/webgen/bin/generate_index
sudo chmod +x /var/lib/webgen/bin/generate_index
```

## The `systemd` Service and Timer
To automate the generation of the `index.html` file, we use `systemd` timers. The generate_index service is triggered by a timer that runs daily.

- Using sftp you can transfer the service and timer files from your local machine:
```bash
put /path/to/generate-index.service 
put /path/to/generate-index.timer
```
-Then move them into the correct directories:
```bash
sudo mv generate-index.service /etc/systemd/system/
sudo mv generate-index.timer /etc/systemd/system/
```
- Now you can enable and start the timer:
```bash
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl enable --now generate-index.timer
```
- Make sure to verify that the timer is actice and that the service runs successfully:
```bash
sudo systemctl status generate-index.timer
sudo systemctl status generate-index.service
```
## Configuring `nginx`
Separating the server block file for the `webgen` service rather than modifying the `nginx.conf` file directly makes it easier to manage configurations.

- You will need to create the direcory for server block configurations if they don't exist:
```bash
sudo mkdir -p /etc/nginx/sites-available
sudo mkdir -p /etc/nginx/sites-enabled
```
- Using sftp you can nginx configuration and server block files from your local machine:
```bash
put /path/to/nginx.conf
put /path/to/webgen
```
- Then move them to the correct directories:
```bash
sudo mv nginx.conf /etc/nginx/
```
